 *In addition, I am fan of Blockchain technology. I have experience to develope some DApps with Solidity Node.js and React.js. If you are intersted, please go [my gallery](https://www.outsystems.com/). I think Blockchain techonology has brought many solutions for the problem that we have not been able to solove it. One of these problem is financial. We have been reviewing every existing financial system again by emerging Bitcoin and we have found some problems. I believe that technology has been changing the social system better and blockchain techonology will be one of them. We know that blockchain has still many problems so I would like to help for that.*
